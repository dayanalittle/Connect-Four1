Connect Four is a browser based game that accepts two players as opponents. In the game, players take turns choosing an index on the game board to place their chip, starting from the bottom row. Once a column is chosen, the chip will slot into the lowest spaces in each column.


###### Hint: Something to keep in mind is that simply knowing the rules of Connect 4 will not guarantee you a win. You need to work on your strategy and technique in order to increase your chances of winning.

- HOW TO PLAY:
  - First, players decide who goes first by simply clicking one of the circles (player 1 is red) 
  - Players will alternate turns by placing their chip in a circle then letting the other player do the same
  - Players must CONNECT FOUR of the same colored chips in a row to win 
  - Only one chip can be played at a time 
  - The game ends when there is a 4-in-a-row in any direction or a tie
  - Have fun!
